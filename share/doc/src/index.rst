Apache CouchDB Documentation
============================

|Apache CouchDB(TM)|_ is a database that uses JSON for documents, JavaScript for
MapReduce queries, and regular HTTP for an API

At the moment, this documentation only covers the basics of CouchDB. In
subsequent releases we hope to expand the documentation significantly. If you
would like to help with that, please subscribe to the `developer mailing list
<http://couchdb.apache.org/#mailing-list>`_ and give a shout.
